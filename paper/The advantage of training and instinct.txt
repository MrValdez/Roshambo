The human brain has two system (citation needed. look up "Brain Tricks - This Is How Your Brain Works" on youtube): System A and System B.

System A is the fast thinker and System B is the slow thinker. For the purpose of this paper, we're call System A, "Instinct" and System B, "Trainer?"

During the training program, Instinct is trained with specific variables or personality. The personality can change over time with the training program having a bigger effect than changes from Instinct.

The Instinct can also act on primers: once a specific situation occurs, a reaction is automatically chosen. If the outcome is negative, the Instinct would temporary send the same situation to System B when it happens again in the short term future. On long term, System B would train the Instinct not to react on the same situation again.
