People respects their opponent when they are able to outpredict them. Some players respects their opponent over time while some players respect their opponent immediately after one prediction.

This personality is reflected with the "Initial Respect On Opponent".

Each move has an "enemy respect" variable which ranges from -100 to +100. Different players have different "respect treshold". Some players would respect their opponent even if they showed that they can predict them once. Some players (usually beginners), will keep doing a move even if their opponent has proven again and again their ability to outpredict them.

As the move is punished or unpunished, the "enemy respect" variable will adjust according to the "respect/disrespect treshold".

Personal story:

I use Blanka and my opponent is using Honda. The first time he used a Headbutt, I immediately countered with a slide. I can hear his voice and it gave me insight to how he thinks. He said to himself, "was that a punish?" Later, he did the move again, and I immediately countered. I heard him exclaim, "yes, its a counter".

In this situation, my opponent gives me his respect on that move over time. He started with a doubt (roughly 50%?) and over time, confirmed my ability to punish his move.

If I didn't punished him on his second try, He might have lowered his respect and might think that it was a fluke (1.0 disrespect modifier) or he might consider that I'm hiding my knowledge of a punish (Yomi layer 4, 0.5 disrespect?). Mind games!

Anectode:

Some expert players will purposely use a bad move in order to see if their opponent can punish that move. If the opponent punishes, then the expert will not use that move. However, if the opponent fails to punish, the expert will still consider that his opponent is hiding that knowledge and will adjust accordingly.

This scenario might be outside the scope of the basic Yomi AI, but is worth a mention.
